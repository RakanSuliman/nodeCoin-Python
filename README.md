# nodeCoin-Python

nodeCoin-Python is a cryptocurrency project, similar to the Java version of nodeCoin but implemented in Python. It demonstrates how doubly linked lists, heaps, and nodes can be used to create a simplified cryptocurrency system for learning purposes.

## Features

- **nodeCoin Data Structure**: Combines linked lists and max heaps to efficiently handle transactions.
- **Insertion and Deletion**: Supports adding and removing nodes (dates) and transactions.
- **Max Transaction Retrieval**: Quickly fetches the highest transaction value for any date using a max heap.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manages user input errors.

## Project Structure

- **MaxHeap**: Manages transactions using a max heap for efficient retrieval of the highest transaction value.
- **Node**: Represents each unique date, which contains a `MaxHeap` of transactions for that day.
- **nodeCoin**: Manages all nodes using a doubly linked list.
- **Transaction**: Represents a transaction with an amount and transaction number.
- **Main**: The main file that ties everything together and handles user interaction.

## Usage

1. **Insert Transaction**: Add a new transaction to a date. Transactions are stored in a max heap.
   ```
   Input: 1 [date] [amount]
   Example: 1 01012023 15.0
   ```

2. **Get Maximum Transaction**: Retrieve the highest transaction for a date.
   ```
   Input: 2 [date]
   Example: 2 01012023
   ```

3. **Remove Maximum Transaction**: Remove the highest transaction for a date.
   ```
   Input: 3 [date]
   Example: 3 01012023
   ```

4. **Get All Transactions**: Retrieve and clear all transactions for a date.
   ```
   Input: 4 [date]
   Example: 4 01012023
   ```

## Big-O Runtime Analysis

| Operation                  | Best Case      | Worst Case        |
|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Insert Transaction        | O(n + log m)   | O(n + log m)      |
| Get Maximum Transaction   | O(n)           | O(n)              |
| Remove Maximum Transaction| O(n + log m)   | O(n + log m)      |
| Get All Transactions      | O(n + m log m) | O(n + m log m)    |

## Comparison with Doubly Linked List or Max Heap Implementation

- **Doubly Linked List (DLL)**: A DLL alone would not efficiently manage transactions as it would require additional sorting. nodeCoin's integrated max heap allows for efficient sorting and retrieval.
- **Max Heap Alone**: A max heap alone cannot categorize transactions by date. nodeCoin combines doubly linked lists for date management with max heaps for transactions, providing a more efficient solution.
  
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RakanSuliman/NodeCoin-Python.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies and run the `main.py` file using Python.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. Enter commands based on the usage instructions.
